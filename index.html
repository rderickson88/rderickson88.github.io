                <p> Welcome to The Bushnell's Digital Learning Game Arcade! </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Bushnell's Digital Learning Program seeks to empower young people to be creative with technology. Our Digital Design & Production Workshop introduces students to computer science through the lens of game design. With gaming quickly becoming one of the most technologically advanced and creative fields for artists, it is important to imbue our learners with the skills to think and adapt to a world more and more dominated by technology. </p>
                <p>This arcade serves as both a resource and an archive for all of the Digital Learning Projects produced through The Bushnell's collaborations with schools and other community groups. Use the menu on the left hand side to navigate to your desired location.</p>
                <p>Every game you will see on the left hand menu has been created as a collaboration with the Impact Academy in Hartford, CT, taught by Mr. Grosner through his "Level Up!" course, an adaptation of our of Digital Design & Production Workshop. While Mr. Grosner and myself work with students to develop fundamental skills, the actual design and coding is left to students to develop, debug, and playtest.</p> 
                <p>These students have learned how to do elementary computer programming in Javascript using the fantastic Construct 3 Game Engine.</p>
                <br>
